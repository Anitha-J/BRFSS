# Abstract
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) take the lives of 17.9 million people every year, 31% of all global deaths. Four out of five CVD deaths are due to heart attacks and strokes. There are several factors that attribute to such strokes and can be classified to two types of risk factors: non-modifiable risk factors (gender, ethnicity, age etc.,) and modifiable risk factors (body weight, blood pressure, smoking habits and such). We chose upon to analyze the data regarding the risk factors and find out the relative importance of such factors to one another. Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data released by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services was found to be most appropriate data source for such analysis. Futhermore, machine learning models are built to predict if a person is susceptible to heart attack based on the given information regarding the risk factors.
